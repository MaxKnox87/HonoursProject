Initial ideas for the project were discussed - it had been decided that the project would focus on WebVR and e-learning, however, the specifics had not yet been confirmed.


Discussed possibilities for the subject of the application, such as a VR yoga trainer, or a VR solar system.


Rob advised that I should consider the scope of the project and to make sure it was achievable.
