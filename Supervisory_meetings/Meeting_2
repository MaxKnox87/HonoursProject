Minutes:


Finalisation of the project specifications were discussed. I had decided that rather than developing a complete WebVR based e-learning application, I would instead use the project to investigate the suitability of WebVR as a medium for e-learning.


Discussed the idea that the project would be broadly be composed of two major phases. An initial research phase where I investigate and discuss the potential for WebVR as a tool for learning, through both an in-depth literature review and a critical analysis of existing applications of WebVR. The second phase would involve developing a range of WebVR testing environments where I implement the techniques and best practices that had been learned in the research phase. 


We discussed the requirements for the first submission -  the project proposal. We talked about elements of the proposal such as the initial, mini literature review and the timetable for project deliverables and milestones. 


We discussed the draft proposal and how it could be improved prior to submission.


Tasks for following meeting:


Prepare and submit project proposal.


Discuss the final submission and grade of the project proposal.


Continue to investigate potential source material for the literature review.


Test early stages of development.
