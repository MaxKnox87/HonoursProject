# Abstract

In this work, research was undertaken to help to determine what the best practices are for incorporating e-learning material into immersive WebVR applications. The implications for this new, highly scalable and device agnostic method of delivering content were beginning to become evident as this research began.

Part of this investigation involved discovering how educational material is currently being incorporated into established virtual reality technologies and frameworks. It was then necessary to take this knowledge, and to see if, and if so how, it is currently being applied to current WebVR development, and to determine if there were any new or improved ways in which it could be utilised during the design and development process.

Informed by the findings of the research, a prototype WebVR application was created. The intention was to experiment with a variety of teaching and learning techniques through the WebVR medium. Data and feedback from these experiments were generated and recorded through usability testing with a group of participants. The results were then analysed and evaluated, in order to try and determine the feasibility of WebVR as a tool for learning.
